My first  portfolio website purely made of Hyper text markup language(HTML),have used knowledge of various tags like <hr> for horizontal line , <p> tag for paragraph or content in my site and also used <a> anchor tags for hyperlinks in hobbies to make it a bit responsive as it redirects to another webpage.
